Day 1:
I started by sketching the basic design of the marketplace using paper and pencil. Along with this, I created the schema, mapping out the relationships between key elements
like products, users, and payments.
Day 2:
I  documented everything I had designed on Day 1 and created a architecture plan for the project, and ensured that everything was structured properly for the next steps.
Day 3:
The main task of the day was API integration. I used Sanity CMS and the UI to fetch products and data..
Day 4:
I worked on the core functionalities of the marketplace, especially the product, cart and checkout pages. The goal was to provide a smooth shopping experience for users, and
I made sure everything was functional and easy to use.
Day 5:
Testing was the focus on this day. I ran performance checks using Lighthouse to measure the speed of the site and worked on fixing any errors that came up. I also tested the
APIs and made sure the site was responsive across all devices.
Day 6:
I deployed the project to Vercel. This was the final step before going live. I tested everything live to check the features were working properly and that the deployment was smooth.

Challenges Faced:
When it came to managing dynamic routing, I faced issues with navigation between pages. The routes werenâ€™t behaving as expected, which caused confusion in the user flow. 
I carefully debugged the routing logic, ensured correct paths were set, and tested everything to guarantee smooth navigation across the app.

Finally, during the Vercel deployment, I faced an error caused by repeated code in the project. To fix this, I cleaned up the redundant code, optimized the structure, and redeployed, 
which solved the issue and ensured a successful deployment.
